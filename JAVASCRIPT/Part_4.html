      <h1>Welcome to Part 9: Your JavaScript Level One Project!</h1>
      <p>For this project you will be building website that will seem to ask much questions
      to users,but you are secretly looking to spof anyone visiting your website
    will be asked a series of questions,only the spy will be able to give specific answers
  you expect. if all questions are answered you will post a secret message in console for the spy to read</p>

  <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her Name and Last Name</li>
    <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 [inclusive of 20 and 30]</li>
    <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall</li>
    <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "Y".</li>

  </ul>

  <p>We are going to leave this project a little more open-ended,but if you feel like you need more
   guidance,check out the solution walkthrough videos. But believe it or not. we've actually
 covered everything you need to know to complete this task, i would suggest you use JavaScript
to prompt the user for the information and set these to variables. Then use those variables to check for the
four conditions to all be true. it's up to you what the secret message is!</p>

<p>A Spy with the following information shoud see your secret message:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jose Johson</li>
  <li>26 years old</li>
  <li>175 cm tall</li>
  <li>Pet name is "Sammy"</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts in whatever order you want, you can even
separate asking for the first name and then another prompt for last name</p>

<p>Also remember to switch out the script src to your own .js file! Right now it's connected to part4.js which contains the solutions</p>
